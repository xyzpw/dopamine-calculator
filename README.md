# dopamine-calculator

Enter the dosage of a drug and it will say the amount of dopamine released from it.<br/>
The information is based on studies I've read. <br/>
:warning:NOTE: Not promoting drug use, I just like sharing the things I read and making it easier, like a project of mine.<3 :pill:

I lost the source to most of these, only recently have I been linking sources, I will try to link my sources from now on. :pill::coffee:<br/> <br/>
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5391296/ - 2 mg/kg methylamphetamine increases glutamte by 500% (Fig. 1)<br/> <br/>

<b>Methylamphetamine Glutamate</b> (https://www.jneurosci.org/content/24/50/11449) I read show more than that, but failed to reach 500% increase, so the max is 500%.<br/> <br/>

<b>Methylamphetamine 8,000% dopamine</b> https://europepmc.org/article/med/19336247 ([Fig. 5](/img/meth_8000.jpg)) There are two papers on methylamphetamine increasing dopamine by 8,000%, but this is one that I found, the other source I never kept and lost it. <br/> <br/>

<b>Dextro/Levo Amphetamine on dopamine/noradrenaline</b> https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3666194/ 1 mg/kg of dextro-amphetamine increased dopamine by 1,500%, although I've read other papers that can be as high as 2,000%. <br/> <br/>

<b>Dextroamphetamine 2,000% dopamine increase per mg/kg</b> https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26255561_Ren_J_Xu_H_Choi_J-K_Jenkins_BG_Chen_YI_Dopaminergic_response_to_graded_dopamine_concentration_elicited_by_four_amphetamine_doses_Synapse_63_764-772 This isn't the main paper I found when I read 2,000% which I never kept source so I no longer have source for that one, but here is another I found. <br/>
> the linear fit is %DA = 1976 * dose. For these calculations, we used amphetamine-induced peak DA magnitudes of 1000% at 0.6 mg/kg and 2000% at 1 mg/kg <br/> <br/>

<b>Dextrtoamphetamine 6,000% dopamine increase</b> https://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/369/1/107 (Fig. 5) I've seen other studies on this that show d-amph can increase dopamine by 6,000%, but I haven't found these since I've lost the source.
> Circles refer to a 0.1-mg/kg dose, diamonds refer to a 0.3-mg/kg dose, triangles refer to a 0.5-mg/kg dose, and squares refer to a 1-mg/kg dose

[methamphetamine is five times more potent than dextroamphetamine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2631950/) <br/> <br/>

<b>Atomoxetine Dopamine/Norepinephrine</b> https://www.nature.com/articles/1395936 <br/> <br/>

<b>Caffeine occupancy on adenosine</b> https://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/53/11/1723 <br/> <br/>

<b>Caffeine Norepinephrine and Epinephrine</b> <br/>
https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM197801262980403, https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM197801262980403 <br/>
With this I was able to estimate/calculate the weight in the studie(s) to about 78-79 kg from the info that was in it. <br/>
The old epinephrine formula was (mg/kg - 1) * 12.5, but this study shows it can be more than this at much lower doses.

<b>New study(s) I found on ethanol and DA</b> https://www.nature.com/articles/1300081, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/074183299290004T?via%3Dihub
