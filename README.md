# dopamine-calculator

Enter the dosage of a drug and it will say the amount of dopamine released from it.<br/>the information is based on studies I've read.

# sources
I lost the source to most of these, only recently have I been linking sources, I will try to link my sources from now on. <br/>
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5391296/ - 2 mg/kg methylamphetamine increases glutamte by 500% <br/>
Other studies (https://www.jneurosci.org/content/24/50/11449) I read show more than that, but failed to reach 500% increase, so the max is 500%.
