# dopamine-calculator

Enter the dosage of a drug and it will say the amount of dopamine released from it.<br/>
The information is based on studies I've read. <br/>
:warning:NOTE: Not promoting drug use, I just like sharing the things I read and making it easier, like a project of mine.

# sources
I lost the source to most of these, only recently have I been linking sources, I will try to link my sources from now on. :pill::coffee:<br/> <br/>
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5391296/ - 2 mg/kg methylamphetamine increases glutamte by 500% (Fig. 1)<br/> <br/>

<b>Methylamphetamine Glutamate</b> (https://www.jneurosci.org/content/24/50/11449) I read show more than that, but failed to reach 500% increase, so the max is 500%.<br/> <br/>

<b>Methylamphetamine 8,000% dopamine</b> https://europepmc.org/article/med/19336247 ([Fig. 5](/img/meth_8000.jpg)) There are two papers on methylamphetamine increasing dopamine by 8,000%, but this is one that I found, the other source I never kept and lost it. <br/> <br/>

<b>Dextro/Levo Amphetamine on dopamine/noradrenaline</b> https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3666194/ 1 mg/kg of dextro-amphetamine increased dopamine by 1,500%, although I've read other papers that can be as high as 2,000%. <br/> <br/>

<b>Dextroamphetamine 2,000% increase</b> https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26255561_Ren_J_Xu_H_Choi_J-K_Jenkins_BG_Chen_YI_Dopaminergic_response_to_graded_dopamine_concentration_elicited_by_four_amphetamine_doses_Synapse_63_764-772 This isn't the main paper I found when I read 2,000% which I never kept source so I no longer have source for that one, but here is another I found. <br/>
> the linear fit is %DA = 1976 * dose. For these calculations, we used amphetamine-induced peak DA magnitudes of 1000% at 0.6 mg/kg and 2000% at 1 mg/kg <br/> <br/>
